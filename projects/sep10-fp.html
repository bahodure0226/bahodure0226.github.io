            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>At the start of the year we were given a list of topics to choose to make a project about, the prompt was that we had the freedom to choose a topic from that list and create a website about the current inventions, and our future inventions for that topic. Throughout the year we completed small parts of this project and finally finished it towards the end. I chose the topic of Sports.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>During this project, at the start of the year we researched current software and hardware in our fields, we made lists and had many assignments about our research. We then brainstormed our own ideas for the future and completed assignments on that as well. Later on, we started studying a tool that we would use for the Freedom Project, I used CSS Animations. In my website, I had CSS, HTML, bootstrap grid, and the components navbar, buttons, and carousel. My website content contained context: why I started to research sports, existing technology: what we used currently, and finally, visions for the future: what I had planned for the future and how it would work. The content was easy to write out because it was all my ideas. The coding part was a bit difficult but taking notes on the tool that I studied as well as the other languages we learned about helped make it easier to remember and use. All of this helped me complete my project fairly without much trouble.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>While I worked, I had some challenges. The first one was when making media queries, which are basically codes that help make your website responsive, I had a code that was not working inside of a certain media query, It was hard to notice, but the problem was that I closed off the media query and the code that did not work was outside of the closing tag. Another challenge I had was trying to resize my images and keeping them in the center for different screen sizes, it required a lot of work when I searched up how to do it, so I just used what I already knew and kept it at 100% screen size so it would look the same for every device even if it would be lower quality for some. The last challenge I had was actually not within the project, but rather presenting it. The presentation was very hard for me because I kept shaking and was nervous for most of it, forgetting all I had planned. The takeaways I had for this project were simple is usually better, and that other people don't notice the same things that you do. I messed up multiple times because of how much code I used for certain parts, but when I kept it simpler, it was so much easier to follow without mess-ups. During the presentation, I felt like everybody could see me shaking and nervous, making my confidence drop, but after my presentation when I asked some of my friends about it, they said I looked completely normal. This made me realize that I should stop worrying about some things like my heart beating or my thoughts in my head, because my audience won't care nor notice. Overall, this project was a nice lesson and it was cool how I was able to make this project in little parts with what I learned throughout the year. </p>
