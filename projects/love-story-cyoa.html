            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>We were assigned a project in which we made our own adventures using links to go through different files and connect them to make a intricate story. Our partners were chosen randomly based on what topics we were interested in. Me and my partner created a love story adventure.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>During this project, me and my partner first had to make a google drawing file, this was our planning stage. This stage included what roles we would take on, what the vague idea of the story would be, and how it would be positioned/modeled. We used markdown files to create our adventure. Since we both wanted to implement our own ideas and not get in each other's way, we decided to create two different branches. When starting the game, you choose between becoming a boy or a girl, I completed the boy side, she completed the girl side. We stuck pretty closely to our original model and were able to complete the project with slight changes.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>While me and my partner worked together, we faced little to no problems. We had one merge conflict because of a bit of miscommunication but we fixed it together quickly and easily. It was originally hard for us to create a story that would satisfy both of us, but when we started talking about our interests, we realized we both had about the same ideas. This made it easier for us to communicate because we had similar tastes. Our story came together quite nicely when we decided to create two separate story lines for either gender the player would pick, this gave us a lot more variety and freedom to choose our own stories without confirming with each other about whether we agree on the story or not. The one challenging part for us was trying to make our markdown files into html files, we gave it a try, we were both quite confused so we stuck with what we already had in the md files. </p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Some takeaways I had from this project are that it is a lot easier to communicate with those that have similar personalities or interests as you. These groups being based on interests made the groupwork with my partner very easy, we both had a fun time since we enjoyed the same things. I also learned that it is best to always have an already working product when trying to create something new. We first created the markdown files because we were both well versed with that language of code. Afterwards, we tried to transfer the same content from the markdown files into html files, this did not turn out too well as we had forgotten some parts of html due to not using it for a while. It was a good thing that we already had the markdown files, we just deleted the html files and decided to stick with what we already had, we didn't reach beyond our abilities and stuck to what we knew we could already do. </p>
