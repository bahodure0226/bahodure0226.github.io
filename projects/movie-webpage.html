            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>We were assigned a project where we had to make a fake movie webpage and come up with a story for our movie with a partner. My partner and I decided on the movie title "Lost Bark" and created a sequel named "Turtle Island"</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>During this project, me and my partner first created a plan with all the different parts that we would be completing. We used html for all of our content, h1 elements for the titles,paragraph elements for most of our text, list elements for character descriptions,images, an input and submit button, and we also used a lot of divs and spans. We used CSS to style all of our webpage, most of our selectors were classes while a few of them were elements or IDS. For CSS styling we used background color, margins, paddings, and borders as well. </p>
            <h2>Self Reflection</h2>
            <p>While me and my partner were working, we did not face many big challenges when coding. We had some minor issues with our code which were easily fixed with some communication and looking through our code. The minor issues we had were things like forgetting the semi colon at the end of the propety value, and not knowing how to use some property commands. We had worked them out by just asking eachother for help. The only challenging parts may have been creating our storyline, we did not have an actual idea for it at first until I mentioned using an already existing one and tweaking it a little bit, my partner agreed with this and we begain to make some progress with our webpage and the rest was pretty simple to do.</p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Some takeaways I had from this are communication makes everything easier, planning ahead really makes the actual coding portion way less confusing and take less time. Me and my partner had a detailed plan page with our names written for what sections we were going to complete. We then had an easy time completing our code, and even outside of school we communicated through slack to let each other know if we needed help or where we were up to in our code. Me and my partner kept track of each other's progress and this made it easier for us to complete the project on time with little to no setbacks or interferences.</p>
